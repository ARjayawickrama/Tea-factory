            The British desire for tea had significant global implications. To break the Chinese monopoly on tea, the British began cultivating it in their colonies. In the 19th century, they established large tea plantations in India, particularly in Assam and Darjeeling, and in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). These regions remain some of the world's most renowned tea producers today.
